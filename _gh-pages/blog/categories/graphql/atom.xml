<p>Last month, I talked with the team at <a href="https://www.graph.cool/">Graph.cool</a> about having them talk through Relay mutations comprehensively as a guest post on the Artsy Engineering blog.

<a name="The.Magic.behind.Relay.Mutations"></a>
<h1>The Magic behind Relay Mutations</h1>

<p><a href="https://facebook.github.io/relay/">Relay</a> is a powerful GraphQL client for React and React Native applications. It was open sourced by Facebook alongside GraphQL in 2015 and is a great tool for supporting you with managing your app's data layer.</p>

<p>In this post, we are going to explore how Relay mutations work by looking at a React Native app. The code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/graphcool-examples/react-native-relay-pokedex-example">GitHub</a>. Our sample application is a simple <em>Pokedex</em>, where users can manage their Pokemons.</p>

<blockquote><p>Note: We're going to assume a basic familiarity with GraphQL in this article. If you haven't heard of GraphQL before, the <a href="www.graphql.org">documentation</a> and the <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/06/19/graphql-for-mobile/">GraphQL for iOS Developers</a> post are great places to start.

<a name="Relay.-.A.brief.Overview"></a>
<h2>Relay - A brief Overview</h2>

<p>Relay is the most sophisticated GraphQL client available at the moment. Like GraphQL, it has been used and battle-tested internally by Facebook for many years before it was open sourced.</p>

<p>Relay surely isn't the easiest framework to learn - but when used correctly, it takes care of managing large parts of your app's data layer in a consistent and reliable manner! It therefore is particularly well-suited for complex applications with lots of data interdependencies and provides outstanding longterm developer productivity.</p>

<a name="Declarative.API.and.Colocation"></a>
<h3>Declarative API and Colocation</h3>

<p>With Relay, React components specify their data requirements in a declarative fashion, making use of GraphQL <em>fragments</em>.</p>

<blockquote><p>A <a href="https://learngraphql.com/basics/fragments">GraphQL fragment</a> is a selection of fields on a GraphQL type. You can use them to define <em>reusable sub-parts</em> of queries or mutations.</p></blockquote>

<p>Considering the <code>PokemonDetails</code> view above, we need to display the Pokemon's name and image. The fragment that represents these data requirements looks as follows:</p>

<pre><code>fragment PokemonDetails on Node {
  ... on Pokemon {
    id
    name
    url
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the <code>id</code> is required so that Relay can identify the objects in the cache, so it's included in the payload as well (even if it's not displayed on the UI).</p>

<p>These fragments are kept in the same file as the React component, so UI and data requirements are <em>colocated</em>. Relay then uses a <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/higher-order-components.html">higher-order component</a> called <a href="https://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/guides-containers.html#content"><code>Relay.Container</code></a>, to wrap the component along with its data requirements. From this point, the developer doesn't have to worry about the data any more! It will be fetched behind the scenes and is made available to the component via its props.</p>

<a name="Build-time.Schema.Validation"></a>
<h3>Build-time Schema Validation</h3>

<p>Another great feature of Relay that ensures developer productivity is  <em>schema validation</em>. At build time, Relay checks your GraphQL queries, fragments and mutations to ensure their compatibility with the GraphQL API. It is thus able to catch any typos or other schema-related errors before you run (or even worse: deploy) your app, saving your users from unpleasant experiences. Note that the schema validation step requires a <a href="https://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/guides-babel-plugin.html">Babel Relay Plugin</a>.</p>

<a name="Mutations.in.Relay"></a>
<h2>Mutations in Relay</h2>

<a name="GraphQL.Recap"></a>
<h3>GraphQL Recap</h3>

<p>In GraphQL, a <em>mutation</em> is the only way to create, update or delete data on the server - they effectively are the GraphQL abstraction for <em>changing state</em> in your backend.</p>

<p>As an example, creating a new Pokemon in our sample app uses the following mutation:</p>

<pre><code>mutation CreatePokemon($name: String!, $url: String!) {
  createPokemon(input: {
    name: $name,
    url: $url
  }) {
    # payload of the mutation (will be returned by the server)
    pokemon {
      id 
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that mutations, similar to queries, also require a <em>payload</em> to be specified. This payload represents the information that we'd like to have returned from the server after the mutation was performed. In the above example, we're asking for the <code>id</code> of the new <code>pokemon</code>.</p>

<a name="The.Magic:.Declarative.Mutations....."></a>
<h3>The Magic: Declarative Mutations ðŸ”®</h3>

<p>Relay doesn't (yet) give the developer the ability to manually modify the data that it stores internally. Instead, with every change, it requires a declarative <em>description</em> of how the local cache should be updated after the change happened in the form of a <a href="https://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/guides-mutations.html#content">mutation</a> and then takes care of the update under the hood.</p>

<p>The description is provided by subclassing <code>Relay.Mutation</code> and implementing (at least) four methods that help Relay to properly update the local store:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>getMutation()</code>: the name of the mutation (from the GraphQL schema)</li>
<li><code>getVariables()</code>: the input variables for the mutation</li>
<li><code>getFatQuery()</code>: a GraphQL query that fetches all data that potentially was changed due to the mutation</li>
<li><code>getConfigs()</code>: a precise specification how the mutation should be incorporated into the cache</li>
</ul>


<p>In the following, we'll take a deeper look at the different kinds of mutations in our sample app, which are used for creating, updating and deleting Pokemons.</p>

<blockquote><p>Note: We're using the <a href="https://www.graph.cool/docs/reference/relay-api/overview-aizoong9ah">Graphcool Relay API</a> for this example. If you used <code>graphql-up</code> to create your own backend, you can explore the API by pasting the endpoint for the Relay API into the address bar of a browser.</p></blockquote>

<a name="Creating.a.new.Pokemon:..code.RANGE_ADD..code."></a>
<h3>Creating a new Pokemon: <code>RANGE_ADD</code></h3>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/yskx5KU.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Let's walk through the different methods and understand what information we have to provide so that Relay can successfully merge the newly created Pokemon into its store.</p>

<p>The first two methods, <code>getMutation()</code> and <code>getVariables()</code> are relatively obvious and can be retrieved directly from the documentation where the API is described.</p>

<p>The implementations look as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="js">getMutation() {
  return Relay.QL`mutation { createPokemon }`
}

getVariables() {
  return {
    name: this.props.name,
    url: this.props.url,
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that the <code>props</code> of a <code>Relay.Mutation</code> are passed through its constructor. Here, we simply provide the <code>name</code> and the <code>url</code> of the Pokemon that is to be created.</p>

<p>Now, on to the interesting parts. In <code>getFatQuery()</code>, we need to specify the parts that might change due to the mutation. Here, we simply specify the <code>viewer</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="js">getFatQuery() {
  return Relay.QL`
    fragment on CreatePokemonPayload {
      viewer {
        allPokemons
      }
    }
  `
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that <em>every</em> subfield of <code>allPokemons</code> is also automatically included with this approach. In our example app, <code>allPokemons</code> is the only point we expect to change after our mutation is performed.</p>

<p>Finally, in <code>getConfigs()</code>, we need to specify the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/guides-mutations.html#mutator-configuration">mutator configurations</a>, telling Relay exactly how the new data should be incorporated into the cache. This is where the magic happens:</p>

<pre><code class="js">getConfigs() {
  return [{
    type: 'RANGE_ADD',
    parentName: 'viewer',
    parentID: this.props.viewerId,
    connectionName: 'allPokemons',
    edgeName: 'edge',
    rangeBehaviors: {
      '': 'append'
    }
  }]
}
</code></pre>

<p>We first express that we want to <em>add</em> the node using <code>RANGE_ADD</code> for the <code>type</code> (there are 5 different types in total).</p>

<p>Relay internally represents the stored data as a graph, so the remaining information expresses where exactly the new node should be hooked into the existing structure.</p>

<p>Let's consider the shape of the data before we move on:</p>

<pre><code>viewer {
  allPokemons {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here we clearly see the direct connection between <code>viewer</code> and the Pokemons goes through <code>allPokemons</code> <em>connection</em>, so the <em>parent</em> of the new Pokemon is the <code>viewer</code>. The name of that connection is <code>allPokemons</code>, and lastly the <code>edgeName</code> is taken from the payload of the mutation.</p>

<p>The last piece, <code>rangeBehaviors</code>, specifies whether we want to <em>append</em> or <em>prepend</em> the new node.</p>

<p>Executing the mutation is as simple as calling <code>commitUpdate</code> on the <code>relay</code> prop that's injected to each component being wrapped with a <code>Relay.Container</code>. An instance of the mutation and the expected variables are passed as arguments to the constructor:</p>

<pre><code class="js">_sendCreatePokemonMutation = () =&gt; {
  const createPokemonMutation = new CreatePokemonMutation({
    viewerId: this.props.viewer.id,
    name: this.state.pokemonName,
    url: this.state.pokemonUrl,
  })
  this.props.relay.commitUpdate(createPokemonMutation)
}
</code></pre>

<a name="Updating.a.Pokemon:..code.FIELDS_CHANGE..code."></a>
<h3>Updating a Pokemon: <code>FIELDS_CHANGE</code></h3>

<p>Like with creating a Pokemon, <code>getMutation()</code> and <code>getVariables()</code> are trivial to implement and can be derived directly from the API documentation:</p>

<pre><code class="js">getMutation() {
  return Relay.QL`mutation { updatePokemon }`
}

getVariables() {
  return {
    id: this.props.id,
    name: this.props.name,
    url: this.props.url,
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In <code>getFatQuery()</code>, we only include the <code>pokemon</code> which includes the updated info this time, since that is the only part we expect to change after our mutation:</p>

<pre><code class="js">getFatQuery() {
  return Relay.QL`
    fragment on UpdatePokemonPayload {
      pokemon
    }
  `
}
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, <code>getConfigs()</code>, this time specifies a mutator configuration of type <code>FIELDS_CHANGE</code> since we're only updating properties on a single Pokemon:</p>

<pre><code class="js">getConfigs() {
  return [{
    type: 'FIELDS_CHANGE',
    fieldIDs: {
      pokemon: this.props.id,
    }
  }]
}
</code></pre>

<p>As sole additional piece of info, we declare the ID of the Pokemon that is being updated so that Relay has this information available when receiving the new Pokemon data.</p>

<a name="Deleting.a.Pokemon:..code.NODE_DELETE..code."></a>
<h3>Deleting a Pokemon: <code>NODE_DELETE</code></h3>

<p>As before, <code>getMutation()</code> and <code>getVariables()</code> are self-explanatory:</p>

<pre><code class="js">getMutation() {
  return Relay.QL`mutation { deletePokemon }`
}

getVariables() {
  return {
    id: this.props.id,
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then, in <code>getFatQuery()</code>, we need to retrieve the <code>pokemon</code> from the mutation payload:</p>

<pre><code class="js">getFatQuery() {
  return Relay.QL`
    fragment on DeletePokemonPayload {
      pokemon
    }
  `
}
</code></pre>

<p>In <code>getConfigs()</code>, we're getting to know another mutator configuration type called <code>NODE_DELETE</code>. This one requires a <code>parentName</code> as well as a <code>connectionName</code>, both coming from the mutation payload and specifying where that node existed in Relay's data graph. Another requirement, that is specifically relevant for the implementation of a GraphQL server, is that the mutation payload of a deleting mutation always needs to return the <code>id</code> of the deleted node so that Relay can find that node in its store. Taking all of this together, our implementation of <code>getConfigs()</code> can be written like so:</p>

<pre><code class="js">getConfigs() {
  return [{
    type: 'NODE_DELETE',
    parentName: 'pokemon',
    connectionName: 'edge',
    deletedIDFieldName: 'deletedId'
  }]
}
</code></pre>

<a name="Wrapping.Up"></a>
<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>

<p>Relay has a lot of benefits that make it a very compelling framework to use for state management and interaction with GraphQL APIs. Its major strengths are a highly optimized cache, thoughtful UI integration as well as the declarative API for data fetching and mutations.</p>

<p>The initial version of Relay came with a notable learning curve due to lots of magic happening behind the scenes. However, Facebook recently released the first release candidates of <a href="https://github.com/facebook/relay/releases/">Relay v1.0.0</a> (<em>Relay Modern</em>) with the <a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/1362748677097871">goal of making Relay generally more approachable</a>.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that Relay isn't the only available GraphQL client. Apollo Client is a great alternative which is a lot easier to get started with. <a href="https://www.graph.cool/docs/tutorials/relay-vs-apollo-iechu0shia/">For a detailed comparison please refer to this article.</a></p>

    <link href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/11/02/improving-page-speed-with-graphql/"/>
    <updated>2016-11-02T14:21:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/11/02/improving-page-speed-with-graphql</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This past year, our team started using a GraphQL orchestration layer that connects various APIs with multiple front-end apps including <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/06/19/graphql-for-mobile">iOS</a>. It also handles caching and extracts some business logic out of our client apps. This helped us not only to be more consistent with the way we fetch data across apps, but also improved developer happiness and even bridged teams by having our web and iOS developers work with the same API layer. This got me thinking what other problems GraphQL could solve at Artsy.</p>

<p>I work on the Publishing Team at Artsy, and we've recently been focused on page speed as a KPI. With so many ways of measuring speed, it's a daunting task but for this post, I'll focus on the way we handled things on the server-side and how integrating GraphQL on our API improved page speed.</p>

<!-- more -->


<a name="Prior.to.GraphQL"></a>
<h2>Prior to GraphQL</h2>

<p>In our publishing CMS called <a href="http://github.com/artsy/positron">Positron</a>, we serve a separate API, database, and front-end from the rest of the Artsy stack. We're also responsible for the delivery and presentation of the content itself. Over the past year we've focused a lot on how the content appears, and now we've opened up time to focus on speed since in the land of content, every second counts.</p>

<p>Before we went ahead with adding a GraphQL-based endpoint to Positron, I spent about a week and refactoring our current codebase. We refactored our router code to make less fetches, made better use of caching, and moved some below-the-fold rendering into the client side. These are important steps towards a faster page, but it doesn't push our technology in a direction that lets us reimagine things.</p>

<a name="Speed.Issues"></a>
<h2>Speed Issues</h2>

<p>We split the speed problem in two: <code>Server Response Time</code> (server-side) and <code>Document Interactive Time</code> (client-side). We currently use Google Analytics to track these <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2383341?hl=en">metrics</a>. There are some inaccuracies with GA such as small sampling, geographic noise (countries with different download speeds), and timeouts being counted as zero, but for our initial testing this will suffice for relative measuring.</p>

<a name="Enter.GraphQL.and.JoiQL"></a>
<h2>Enter GraphQL and JoiQL</h2>

<p>Our very own <a href="https://twitter.com/craigspaeth">Craig Spaeth</a> recently started working on a project called <a href="https://github.com/muraljs/mural">Mural</a>. It's a framework for React and GraphQL. One library that came out of this project is called <a href="http://github.com/muraljs/joiql">JoiQL</a>. It's a The main purpose of JoiQL is to convert <a href="http://github.com/hapijs/joi">Joi</a> schemas into GraphQL schemas.</p>

<p>We already use Joi in Positron so creating a GraphQL-based endpoint was trivial with JoiQL. Note that while JoiQL is currently used in production, it's still a beta project! Below is an example of how the JoiQL setup works.</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">const joiql = require('../')
const { object, string, number, array, date } = require('joi')
const app = require('express')()
const graphqlHTTP = require('express-graphql')

// Given a Joi schema:
const Article = object({
  title: string(),
  body: string(),
  published_at: date()
}).meta({
  args: { id: number().required() }
})

// Define api with JoiQL like this:
const api = joiql({
  query: {
    article: Article
  }
})

// Resolve the request using a Koa 2 style middleware pattern:
api.use((ctx, next) =&gt; {
  return new Promise (resolve, reject) -&gt;
    // Method that fetches an article based on the query
    findArticle(ctx.req.query.article.args), (err, results) -&gt;
      ctx.res.article = results.article
      next()
      resolve()
})

// Finally, mount our schema to express:
app.use('/graphql', graphqlHTTP({
  schema: api.schema,
  graphiql: true
}))
app.listen(3000, () =&gt; console.log('listening on 3000'))
</code></pre>

<p>You can see how simple it becomes to convert apps that already use Joi with JoiQL. Joi provides a nice API for building GraphQL schemas with minimal boilerplate and we also get a nice Koa 2 style middleware pattern that lets us hook into a downstream/upstream flow. This downstream/upstream flow could be useful later on if we were to get really granular with measuring speed. For instance, if we decide to track the speed of the whole lifecycle of a request, we could do something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">api.use((ctx, next) =&gt; {
  startTIme = Date.now()
  next()
  console.log(Date.now() - startTime)
}

api.use((ctx, next) =&gt; {
  // fetch content here
  next() #we get bumped back up after this
})
</code></pre>

<a name="Results"></a>
<h2>Results</h2>

<p>The two features of GraphQL that have been helpful for reducing page speed are:
1. Reduced payload because you only request the data you need
2. Multiple fetches can be coalesced into a single request</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, decreased payload and coalesced requests are the same two features <a href="http://twitter.com/orta">Orta</a> describes in part of his post on the killer features of <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/06/19/graphql-for-mobile">GraphQL for Mobile</a>.</p>

<a name="Reduced.Payload"></a>
<h3>Reduced Payload</h3>

<p>Reduced payload turned out to be one of the biggest factors in reducing speed. Just after October 27 we switched over to using GraphQL on our <a href="http://m.artsy.net/articles">mobile articles landing page</a>.</p>

<p></div></div><a href='/images/2016-11-02-improving-page-speed-with-graphql/download_time.png'><img src="/images/2016-11-02-improving-page-speed-with-graphql/download_time.png"></a><div class='meta-container'><header>&nbsp;</header></div><div class='date-container'>&nbsp;</div><div class='content-container'><div class='entry-content'></p>

<p>Since we were previously getting back collection of articles with all of its content, rendering a simple page with a list of articles meant the payload size was unnecessarily huge. Now, we only request a few things like the title and image without having to do any extra work. This is especially important for mobile devices where we encounter slow network speeds!</p>

<a name="Multiple.fetches"></a>
<h3>Multiple fetches</h3>

<p>Although we haven't made use of this in production yet, I anticipate that the ability to coalesce requests will be significant. For example, to render an article page, there are up to five fetches that can be requested by our front-end app with a normal REST API. Now, we can combine the requests to a single fetch, which moves the responsibility of coalescing requests from aggregating slow HTTP requests to fanning out fast database queries. If we aggregate the request and cache the response using a client like <a href="https://github.com/kadirahq/lokka">Lokka</a>, our future looks bright.</p>

<a name="What.s.next."></a>
<h2>What's next?</h2>

<p>Besides making use of this new endpoint on all the things, I think the next big win with GraphQL is to add <a href="http://graphql.org/learn/queries/#mutations">mutations</a>. By adding support for mutations, we can modify our data with GraphQL just as simply as we can query it.</p>

<p>We currently use a combination of Backbone and React to edit articles on our front-end CMS. After we move our CMS's data platform to GraphQL, we can move away from frameworks like Backbone and towards managing state containers like Redux which are made to work with GraphQL. Features like revision history and undo events would feel natural with state containers like Redux and a joy for our editors!</p>

<p>In the context of speed, some other topics I look forward to exploring are optimizing expensive database queries and client-side asset compression.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>GraphQL is something you may have heard in passing, usually from the web team. It's a Facebook API technology, that describes itself as a <em>A Data Query Language and Runtime</em>. GraphQL is a <a href="http://facebook.github.io/graphql/">spec</a>, and there are <a href="https://github.com/chentsulin/awesome-graphql#libraries">multiple implementations</a> of it.

<a name="So.what.is.GraphQL"></a>
<h3>So what is GraphQL</h3>

<p>You can get the full explanation on <a href="http://graphql.org">the GraphQL website</a>. Though, I found running through <a href="https://learngraphql.com">Learn GraphQL</a> site to really hammer down how it works. Reading the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/05/01/graphql-introduction.html">introduction blog post</a> can be useful too.</p>

<p>We use GraphQL as an API middle-layer. It acts as an intermediate layer between multiple front-end clients and multiple back-end APIs. This means it can easily coalesce many API calls into a single request, this can be a <em>massive</em> user experience improvement when you have a screen that requires information from varied sources before you can present anything to a user.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016-06-19-graphql-for-iOS-devs/graphQL.svg" width=100%></p>

<p>As a client, you <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eigen/blob/dac7c80b66b600f9a45aaae6095544fe420f0bbc/Artsy/Networking/ARRouter.m#L1011">send</a> a "<a href="http://graphql.org/docs/getting-started/#queries">JSON-shaped query</a>" structure, which is hierarchical and easy to read:</p>

<pre><code class="json">{
  artwork(id: "kimber-berry-as-close-to-magic-as-you-can-get") {
    id
    additional_information

    is_price_hidden
    is_inquireable
  }
}
</code></pre>

<blockquote><p>This will search for a <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artwork/kimber-berry-as-close-to-magic-as-you-can-get">specific artwork</a>, sending back the Artwork's <code>id</code>, <code>additional_information</code>, <code>is_price_hidden</code> and <code>is_inquireable</code>.</p></blockquote>

<p>It's important to note here, the data being sent <em>back</em> is only what you ask for. This is not defined on the server as a <em>short</em> or <em>embedded</em> version of a model, but the specific data the client requested. When bandwidth and speed is crucial, this is the other way in which GraphQL improves the app-user experience.</p>

<p>That's the two killer features:</p>

<ol>
<li>Coalesce Multiple Network Requests. Reducing the amount of network requests that need to be made.</li>
<li>Only Send The Data You Want. Only sending the data you are interested in.</li>
</ol>


<p>With mobile apps you're working with unreliable, slow networks with high bandwidth costs. Optimising towards less networking with richer data means your app is more resiliant to things outside of your control.</p>

<p>This is in stark contrast to existing API concepts, like <a href="http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html">HAL</a> and <a href="http://jsonapi.org">JSON-API</a> - both of which are optimised for caching, and rely on "one model, one request" types of API access. E.g. a list of Artworks would actually contain a list of hrefs instead of the model data, and you have to fetch each model as a separate request.</p>

<h3>Using GraphQL</h3>

<p>Artsy's GraphQL server is (unsurprisingly) open-source, it's at <a href="https://github.com/artsy/metaphysics">artsy/metaphysics</a>. However, it's not publicly accessible, (<a href="https://github.com/artsy/metaphysics/issues/279">yet?</a>). One of the coolest things about developing against a GraphQL server is GraphiQL - an IDE for exploring your API. I can't show you ours, but I can send you to <a href="http://clayallsopp.com">Clay Allsop's</a> <a href="https://www.graphqlhub.com">GraphQLHub</a>:</p>

<p>GraphQL comes with a playground for the API! It's amazing! Clay called it the <a href="https://medium.com/the-graphqlhub/graphiql-graphql-s-killer-app-9896242b2125#.6ht6374bq">"Killer App" of GraphQL</a> - I'm inclined to concur. I've never had API docs this useful. This is built on top of the schema/docs/type reflection APIs inside the GraphQL spec.</p>

<h3>How GraphQL Changed How We Write Native Code</h3>

<a name="View.Models"></a>
<h4>View Models</h4>

<p>Our GraphQL server is owned by the <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/03/28/artsy-engineering-organization-stack/">web-practice</a> and the mobile practice also help out occasionally. This ownership distinction is important, an API like this would normally be handled by our platform team.</p>

<p>Because of Metaphysics' ownership as a "front-end" product, it can contain additional information that is specific to front-end needs. For example, in our first example of a request to our GraphQL server we requested <code>id</code>, <code>additional_information</code>, <code>is_price_hidden</code> and <code>is_inquireable</code> - only two of these items come from the database. Both is <code>is_price_hidden</code> and <code>is_inquireable</code> are derived from the API results on the server.</p>

<p>This is <em>awesome</em>, because before a <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eigen/blob/dac7c80b66b600f9a45aaae6095544fe420f0bbc/Artsy/Views/Artwork/ARArtworkActionsView.m#L310-L362">lot of this logic</a> existed in a <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eigen/blob/dac7c80b66b600f9a45aaae6095544fe420f0bbc/Artsy/Views/Artwork/ARArtworkActionsView.m#L108-L109">Google Doc</a> which needed to be re-implemented in 3-4 clients. On the native side we would find we were out-of-date mid-release cycle and needed to rush to catch up.</p>

<p>So, what does this mean for view models? It lessens the need for them. If you can move a lot of your derived data to the server - this handles the logic that goes in a view model for you. Now it is provided server-side, and is consistent across platforms.</p>

<p>We've not stopped writing view models, but now discussions on them includes "should this move to Metaphysics?".</p>

<a name="React.Native"></a>
<h4>React Native</h4>

<p>We've already <a href="https://twitter.com/orta/status/734880605322776576">shipped one full view controller</a> in <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a> for our flagship app, <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eigen/">Eigen</a>. The advantages that came from GraphQL were a big part of the discussion around using React Native.</p>

<p>There will be longer articles on the "why" and "how" we choose to work this way. However, the key thing that we're excited about in using React Native is Relay. Using Relay, our <a href="https://github.com/artsy/emission/tree/2ac6e9fc0f85ca81483bcbd6c841841104f07833/lib/components/artist">views</a> can declare a fragment of the GraphQL query that each respective <a href="https://github.com/artsy/emission/blob/2ac6e9fc0f85ca81483bcbd6c841841104f07833/lib/components/artist/biography.js#L60-L69">view needs</a>.</p>

<p>So, in our Artist View Controller, the Biography "View" (<a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/native-components-ios.html">component</a>) declares "when I am in the view hierarchy, you need to grab a <code>bio</code>, and <code>blurb</code>"</p>

<pre><code class="js">export default Relay.createContainer(Biography, {
  fragments: {
    artist: () =&gt; Relay.QL`
      fragment on Artist {
        bio
        blurb
      }
    `,
  }
});
</code></pre>

<p>Once your views are declaring what data they need, and are acting on that data - you see less of a need to use models.</p>

<hr />

<p>GraphQL is having a massive impact in the way that we write our apps. It means we can make much faster mobile apps, as the network is our critical path. Faster apps means happier users, happier users means happier developers. I want to be happy. So I'm thankful that the <a href="https://github.com/artsy/metaphysics/graphs/contributors">Web practice</a> gave GraphQL a try, and <a href="https://github.com/artsy/metaphysics/pull/243">welcome'd</a> <a href="https://github.com/artsy/metaphysics/pull/313">us</a> <a href="https://github.com/artsy/metaphysics/pull/226">to</a> <a href="https://github.com/artsy/metaphysics/pull/302">the</a> <a href="https://github.com/artsy/metaphysics/issues/2">party</a>.</p>

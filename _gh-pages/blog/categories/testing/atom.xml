    <id>http://artsy.github.io/blog/2015/09/24/splitting-up-a-large-test-suite</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A while back, we wrote about <a href="/blog/2012/10/09/how-to-run-rspec-test-suites-in-parallel-with-jenkins-ci-build-flow/">How to Run RSpec Test Suites in Parallel with Jenkins CI Build Flow</a>. A version of that still handles our largest test suite, but over time the initial division of specs became unbalanced. We ended up with some tasks that took twice as long as others. Even worse, in an attempt to rebalance task times, we ended up with awkward file patterns like <code>'spec/api/**/[a-m]*_spec.rb'</code>.</p>

<p>To keep our parallel spec tasks approximately equal in size and to support arbitrary concurrency, we've added a new <code>spec:sliced</code> task:</p>

<!-- more -->


<pre><code class="ruby">namespace :spec do
  task :set_up_spec_files do
    spec_files = Dir['spec/**/*_spec.rb']
    @spec_file_digests = Hash[spec_files.map { |f| [f, Zlib.crc32(f)] }]
  end

  RSpec::Core::RakeTask.new(:sliced, [:index, :concurrency] =&gt; :set_up_spec_files) do |t, args|
    index = args[:index].to_i
    concurrency = args[:concurrency].to_i
    t.pattern = @spec_file_digests.select { |f, d| d % concurrency == index }.keys
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the <code>set_up_spec_files</code> helper task builds a hash of spec file paths and corresponding checksums. When we invoke the <code>sliced</code> task with <code>index</code> and <code>concurrency</code> values (e.g., <code>0</code> and <code>5</code>), only the spec files with checksums equal to <code>0</code> when mod-ed by <code>5</code> are run. Thus, the Jenkins build flow would look like:</p>

<pre><code class="java">parallel (
  {build("master-ci-task", tasks: "spec:sliced[0,5]")},
  {build("master-ci-task", tasks: "spec:sliced[1,5]")},
  {build("master-ci-task", tasks: "spec:sliced[2,5]")},
  {build("master-ci-task", tasks: "spec:sliced[3,5]")},
  {build("master-ci-task", tasks: "spec:sliced[4,5]")}
)
build("master-ci-succeeded")
</code></pre>

<p>Now, spec times <em>might</em> continue to be unbalanced despite files being split up approximately evenly. (For a more thorough approach based on recording spec times, see <a href="https://github.com/ArturT/knapsack">knapsack</a>.) However, this little bit of randomness was a big improvement over our previous approach, and promises to scale in a uniform manner.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Artsy practices a sort of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery">continuous delivery</a>. We keep release cycles short and the process of reviewing, testing, and deploying our software as reliable, fast, and automated as possible. (This blog has touched on these practices <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/categories/testing/">multiple</a> <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/categories/continuous-integration">times</a>.)</p>

<p>Usually, commits that have been reviewed and merged are immediately built and tested. Successfully built versions of the codebase are often automatically deployed to a staging environment. On an automated or frequent-but-manual basis, that version is deployed to a production environment. Thus, commits form a pipeline:</p>

<ul>
<li>From developers' working branches</li>
<li>To the master branch</li>
<li>Through a hopefully-successful build</li>
<li>To a staging environment</li>
<li>To production</li>
</ul>


<p>The number of apps and services we deploy has grown to <em>dozens</em> per team, so sometimes things fall through the cracks. We've been using <a href="https://github.com/joeyAghion/releasecop">Releasecop</a> for the last few months to get gentle email reminders when an environment could use a deploy.</p>

<!-- more -->


<pre><code>gem install releasecop
releasecop edit
</code></pre>

<p>This opens a <em>manifest</em> file where you can describe the sequence of git remotes and branches that make up your own release pipeline. For example:</p>

<pre><code>{
  "projects": {
    "charge": [
      { "name": "master", "git": "git@github.com:artsy/charge.git" },
      { "name": "staging", "git": "git@heroku.com:charge-staging.git" },
      { "name": "production", "git": "git@heroku.com:charge-production.git" }
    ],
    "gravity": [
      { "name": "master", "git": "git@github.com:artsy/gravity.git" },
      { "name": "master-succeeded", "git": "git@github.com:artsy/gravity.git", "branch": "master-succeeded" },
      { "name": "staging", "git": "git@github.com:artsy/gravity.git", "branch": "staging" },
      { "name": "production", "git": "git@github.com:artsy/gravity.git", "branch": "production" }
    ]
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>charge</code> app is a typical deployment to Heroku. Work progresses from the <code>master</code> branch to a <code>charge-staging</code> app to a <code>charge-production</code> app. The <code>gravity</code> app is a more complicated, non-Heroku deployment. It updates git branches to reflect what has been merged (<code>master</code>), tested (<code>master-succeeded</code>), deployed to staging, and deployed to production.</p>

<p>Run the <code>releasecop check [app]</code> command to report the status of your apps' releases:</p>

<pre><code>$ releasecop check --all
charge...
  staging is up-to-date with master
  production is up-to-date with staging
gravity...
  master-succeeded is up-to-date with master
  staging is up-to-date with master-succeeded
  production is behind staging by:

    <id>http://artsy.github.io/blog/2015/07/06/how-to-write-unit-tests-like-a-brood-parasite</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To a beginner, <a href="http://ocmock.org/">OCMock</a> looks scary. The syntax is strange, the idea of stubbing seems complicated, and skirting around the need to use it at all times kind of works out for a while.</p>

<pre><code class="objc">[[[mock stub] // three brackets!!

[OCMockObject niceMockForClass:UINavigationItem.class]; // it has to be told to be nice?
</code></pre>

<p>All of this can be overwhelming for someone who just wants to write simple unit tests for a particular view controller.</p>

<p>Once you look into the specifics of OCMock, however, things get less terrifying really quickly. It is helpful to compare OCMock’s approach to stubbing to the <a href="https://vimeo.com/60553870">behaviors of certain bird species</a>. As always, the soothing voice of David Attenborough brings clarity and joy to even the most mundane puzzles of life’s journey.</p>

<!-- more -->


<hr />

<p>For those who hate birds and videos of them, the cuckoo duck is known for leaving its eggs in the nests of other birds precisely as their unsuspecting victims lay their own. The new host parents cannot differentiate their offspring from those of the duck and inadvertently raise the duck chicks to maturity.</p>

<p>In a similar fashion, OCMock can place trick objects in your <del>nest</del> test code with whichever custom configuration suits your needs. The ‘host’ subject under test can’t differentiate these mock objects from the objects they’ve been written to use, and you can decide exactly how you’d like the mock objects to behave in your testing environment. This was especially helpful for a method I created that relies on information from an asynchronous network request. We’ll call it the <code>DataSource</code> of a <code>StatusMonitor</code> class.</p>

<pre><code class="objc">- (BOOL)updatedStatus
{
    [DataSource getNewDataWithNetworkRequest];
    /// some code that relies on this new data
}
</code></pre>

<p>In my view controller, I can use a <code>StatusMonitor</code> to decide whether or not a notification should appear in my view:</p>

<pre><code class="objc">- (void)viewWillAppear
{
    [super viewWillAppear];

/// show or hide a notification based on this status
    BOOL shouldShowNotification = [self.statusMonitor updatedStatus];
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I’m writing tests for this view controller, I don’t care about <code>DataSource</code> - I just want to make sure the view controller knows when to show or hide a notification correctly depending on the new value from its StatusMonitor. I’d really like to avoid making any network requests within these kinds of tests. This is where the bird strategy comes in.</p>

<p>In my tests, I can create a decoy <code>StatusMonitor</code> with its corresponding methods using OCMock.</p>

<pre><code class="objc">StatusMonitor *statusMonitor = [[ARCMSStatusMonitor alloc] init];
id mockMonitor = [OCMockObject partialMockForObject:statusMonitor];

[[[mockMonitor stub] andReturn:@YES] checkStatus];
</code></pre>

<hr />

<p>I can then assign mockMonitor to the <code>statusMonitor</code> property of my view controller under test. In this way, the dependency on a network connection disappears, my view controller is happy, and my test can isolate the functionality I care about. OCMock provides some excellent documentation of what they mean by ‘nice’ and some other interesting things you can do with mock objects <a href="http://ocmock.org/features/">here</a>. For those interested in David Attenborough, birds, or natural history in general, I recommend  <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/collections/p0048522">Nature</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/08/08/CocoaPods-Caching/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-08T11:46:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/08/08/CocoaPods-Caching</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/08/07/taking-a-snapshot-with-second-curtain/">Ash said earlier</a> we like using Continuous Integration. Today I spent a large amount of time migrating us to use the new CocoaPods caching system in Travis CI. To make up for my lost time I'm passing on what I've learned and also showing how we do CI at Artsy with Objective-C apps. If you're interested in how we do it in Swift, you can just check <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eidolon">Eidolon</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>First and foremost, this only works if you are paying for Travis CI.</p>

<p>Travis CI recently merged in support for <a href="http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/caching/">Caching of CocoaPods</a> - this is great! By using this, we've reduced our build times from an average of about 10 minutes, to about 7 minutes. It works by using your <code>Podfile.lock</code> as a key to cache your <code>Pods</code> directory, if the lock hasn't changed then there's no need to update the Cache and so <code>pod install</code> is not called on your project. This caused me an issue as the <code>[Project].xcworkspace</code> file that CocoaPods generates was not in source control, and the app wouldn't build. Useful note, if you're using <a href="http://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podfile.html#pod">development pods</a> in your build you probably shouldn't use this as your Pods directory can get out of sync with the cached version.</p>

<p>We use a <a href="https://github.com/artsy/eidolon/blob/master/Makefile">Makefile</a> to separate the tasks required to build, test and deploy an app. The general structure of our Makefile is:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> Action        </th>
<th> Reason </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> Constants </td>
<td> A collection of constants that get resued by different make tasks. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> CI Tasks </td>
<td> Separate commands necessary for running Xcode projects from the terminal. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Actions </td>
<td> Commands that manipulate your project state, or maintainance commands. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Deployment </td>
<td> Commands to get your app ready for the App Store, or Hockey. </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>If you don't know the syntax for Make, essentially if it's on the same line you're either setting constants or calling other make commands. If it's on a separate line then you are running a shell command.</p>

<p>This is the <a href="http://orta.io/#folio-header-unit">Artsy Folio</a> Makefile in full:</p>

<p>That gives you a sense of the commands that you can run from the terminal in our projects, next we need to look at the <code>.travis.yml</code> file.</p>

<pre><code class="make">language: objective-c

  - bundler
  - cocoapods

env:
  - UPLOAD_IOS_SNAPSHOT_BUCKET_NAME=eigen-ci UPLOAD_IOS_SNAPSHOT_BUCKET_PR...

before_install:
  - 'echo ''gem: --no-ri --no-rdoc'' &gt; ~/.gemrc'
  - cp .netrc ~
  - chmod 600 .netrc
  - pod repo add artsy https://github.com/artsy/Specs.git

before_script:
  - gem install second_curtain
  - make ci

script:
  - make test
  - make lint
</code></pre>

<p>This is nice and simple. It was built to use multiple travis build steps. This makes the CI output a lot more readable as an end user. Travis will by default collapse the shell output for different build stages leaving only the <code>script</code> stage defaulting to being exposed. Here is an example of what you see on a failing test:</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/2014-08-08-CocoaPods-Caching/failing_travis_screenshot.png" alt='Travis CI Failure'>
</center>


<p>We use a gem with a binary in <a href="https://github.com/AshFurrow/second_curtain/">second_curtain</a>, and this came with bundler caching issues in Travis. The solution was to ignore bundler and run <code>gem install second_curtain</code> each time. To increase the speed we also ensured that documentation is not being generated. If you are interested in what's going on with the <code>.netrc</code>, read my blog post on <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/06/20/artsys-first-closed-source-pod/">Artsy's first Closed Source Pod</a>.</p>

<p>We will continue pushing the state of the art in iOS deployment, in building our own tools and using everything available to increase developer happiness. If you're into this we're always looking to hire people with a good open source track record or street smarts. Here's <a href="https://artsy.net/job/mobile-engineer">the jobs page</a>.</p>

    <id>http://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/08/07/taking-a-snapshot-with-second-curtain</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At Artsy, we try hard to <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/orta/getting-eigen-out?slide=35">test</a>
our iOS applications to ensure that we avoid regressions and have a clearly
defined spec of how our apps should look and behave. One of the core pieces of
our testing setup is <a href="https://github.com/facebook/ios-snapshot-test-case">FBSnapshotTestCase</a>,
a library written by Facebook to compare views at runtime with images of those
views that are known to be correct. If the images differ, the test fails. We
also use <a href="https://travis-ci.org">Travis</a> for continuous integration.</p>

<p>Lately, we've been noticing a friction between the developers on the iOS team
and the tools we're using to test our apps: while Travis allows us to easily
access the logs of test runs, it can only indicate that a snapshot test failed,
not why it failed. That's because the images that are compared are locked on
Travis' machine – we cannot access those images, so we can't see the
differences. This is <em>really</em> promblematic when the tests pass locally but fail
only on Travis.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>A few weeks ago, <a href="http://twitter.com/orta">Orta</a> and I were discussing this
problem and we came up with a potential solution. Since the images were stored
on disk on Travis' machine, why not just upload them somewhere we <em>can</em> see
them? Like an S3 bucket. We could even generate a basic HTML page showing you
the different test failures.</p>

<p>Time passed and, later on, I had tests passing locally but failing on Travis.
I saw an opportunity to build something new. I'm not a proficient Ruby developer,
but I enjoy learning new things, so I decided to create a Ruby gem that could
fit within our existing testing pipeline. A lot of the structure for the code
came from an existing gem we already use with Travis, <a href="https://github.com/supermarin/xcpretty">xcpretty</a>.
With an example of how gems that support iOS testing are written, I was on my
way to creating my own.</p>

<p>At first, things were very difficult. While I had contributed small patches to
existing Ruby projects before, I had never created a brand new one from scratch.
The existing <a href="http://guides.rubygems.org/make-your-own-gem/">guides</a> were very
helpful, and I found help from the CocoaPods developers when I had questions
about things like the arcane semantics of Ruby's <code>require</code> syntax.</p>

<p>Eventually, I had a working proof-of-concept. Everything seemed ready to go, and
I prepared to incorporate my new tool, which I called <a href="https://github.com/AshFurrow/second_curtain">Second Curtain</a>,
into my pull request on the Artsy repo. But there was a problem.</p>

<p>Second Curtain relies on environment variables to get access to the S3 bucket
where it stores the images. I planned on using Travis' system to <a href="http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/encryption-keys/">encrypt</a>
those credentials. It turns out, for very good reasons, encrypted environment
variables are not available on pull requests created on forks of repositories.
This is a problem because of the way that <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2012/01/29/how-art-dot-sy-uses-github-to-build-art-dot-sy/">Artsy uses GitHub</a>.
While it's not a problem for a closed-source repository to have (restrictive)
access to an S3 bucket, it would be irresponsible to expose S3 credentials for
an open-source project. I'm <a href="https://github.com/AshFurrow/second_curtain/issues/5">working</a>
on a solution.</p>

<p>Orta helped with the design aspect of the tool; while uploading the images was
sufficient, we could make the process of seeing the differences between the two
images even easier. He created a <a href="https://eigen-ci.s3.amazonaws.com/snapshots/2014-08-04--15-47/index.html">HTML page</a>
that would allow developers to see the before-and-after versions by moving their
mouse cursor over the different images.</p>

<p><img src="http://static.ashfurrow.com/github/second_curtain.png" alt="Image Diff" /></p>

<p>In the end, I got Second Curtain to work with Artsy's iOS repository and I
discovered the discrepency between the two images: due to a timezone difference
between my computer and Travis', a date was being formatted differently. Not a
difficult thing to fix, but not something I would have ever been able to
discover had I not been able to see the images side-by-side.</p>

<p>So after all that, one line of Objective-C was changed and the tests passed – my
pull request was merged. I learnt a lot about how Ruby developers structure
their code and what tools they use to write software. While I'm happy to return
to iOS apps for a while, it was a great experience and I'm hoping to bring some
of the ideas I discovered writing Ruby back to Objective-C.</p>

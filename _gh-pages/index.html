        <p><a href="https://github.com/artsy/force">Force</a> is Artsy's main website, <a href="https://www.artsy.net">artsy.net</a>. In the three years since it was <a href="http://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/09/05/we-open-sourced-our-isomorphic-javascript-website/">open-sourced</a>, it has provided a solid foundation to build features on top of without a lot of the costs associated with growth. It is an early example of Isomorphic ("universal") JavaScript, built on top of Express, Backbone, CoffeeScript, Stylus and Jade. It is also highly modular, adopting patterns laid down by its parent project,  <a href="https://github.com/artsy/ezel">Ezel</a>.</p>

<p>When first developed these technologies made a lot of sense; CoffeeScript fixed many of the problems with JavaScript pre-ES6, and Jade / Stylus made working with HTML / CSS much more elegant. As time progressed and new technologies became a thing these solutions starting feeling more burdensome to continue building features with and many of our developers longed to start using next-generation tools like React.</p>

        <p>Once Danger Ruby was stable enough for everyday use in 2015, it became obvious that running Danger on CI was both a
positive and a negative. On the positive side, Danger has access to all artifacts created during testing - and on the negative
side it takes a long time to get feedback. It was obvious that Danger could <a href="https://github.com/danger/danger/issues/42">run on a server</a>, but it was a big unknown what that could look like.</p>

<p>Eventually, <a href="/blog/2017/06/30/danger-one-oh-again/">I came to the conclusion</a> that we would need a JavaScript replacement of Danger - and so I applied
constraints to Danger JS that made a server-side version of Danger a possibility. It was a stroke of luck that around the
time Danger JS became usable for day to day usage, that GitHub introduced <a href="https://developer.github.com/changes/2016-09-14-Integrations-Early-Access/">GitHub Apps</a> - so I started work on Peril. Peril is server-side Danger. The rest of this post talks about how we use it Artsy today, how you can use it yourself and where it's heading.</p>

        <p>Artsy has always had a focus on Art meets Science, and we <a href="https://www.meetup.com/CocoaPods-NYC/messages/boards/thread/50940969">hosted a meet-up in July</a> that really hits on both. We had a collection of Artsy Staff, members of <a href="http://www.artandfeminism.org">Art + Feminism</a> NYC, the <a href="/blog/2015/08/10/peer-lab/">CocoaPods Peer Lab</a>, <a href="http://www.artspracticum.org">New York Arts Practicum</a> and volunteers from <a href="https://nyc.wikimedia.org/">Wikimedia NYC</a> all helping out.</p>

<p>We came with two aims:</p>

<ul>
<li>Help anyone interested in contributing to Wikipedia get started.</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://www.artsy.net/categories">The Art Genome Project</a>(TAGP) to improve Wikidata entries for women Artists.</li>
</ul>


<p>I helped out with the second part, and the rest of this post will be about the lessons learned during this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit-a-thon">editathon</a>.</p>

  <div class="content-container">
    
    
        <p>During Artsy's recent 2017 Hackathon we tackled making all of our editorial content <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility">accessible</a>. The idea was hatched at  Berlin JSConf this spring, where <a href="https://youtu.be/H4FzW9oFObs">Laura Carvajal gave a talk</a> following the <em>Financial Times</em>' experience implementing better accessibility requirements, and how they built these considerations into their testing process.</p>

<p>What does accessibility mean in a browser? Generally the term refers to supporting the wide range of assistive technologies for users with vision or motor impairments. These include screen readers, as well as mouseless navigation using a keyboard, eye tracking and other devices. Interestingly these technologies are implemented at the OS level rather than the browser itself. Mac's OS includes a built in screen-reader, and <a href="http://www.freedomscientific.com/Products/Blindness/JAWS">JAWS</a> is the most popular application in this vein. It is also notable that browsers do not track users who employ assistive tools.</p>

<p>Two users on <a href="http://webaim.org/discussion/mail_thread?thread=6326">WebAIM's forum</a> excellently present the case for accessibility as a developer's responsibility:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Users may be highly resistant to having their disabilities identified as they go throughout the web. Most persons with disabilities would really just rather that <em>the Web just work</em> for them."</p>

<p>"Looking at accessibility as a way to serve a specific population is missing the point that accessibility is about inclusion of all people."</p></blockquote>

<p>A central tenant of Artsy's mission is to 'make art as accessible as music'. By expanding accessibility for the visually and motor impaired to writing on art and culture, this projects allows us to follow through on this statement in a very literal way. Furthermore, there's no reason to ignore this audience; accommodating use of assistive technologies is an ethically responsible thing to do.</p>

        <p>We have a few apps now, but one of them isn't really used by anyone other than developers. This is <a href="https://github.com/artsy/emission/tree/master/Example">our React Native host app</a>. We built our React Native components <a href="/blog/2016/08/24/On-Emission/">as a library</a> to be consumed by our other apps. Our development environment for these components is a unique app that acts as a host for the React Native components. It's effectively a long tableview.</p>

<p>This app is often updated for developers, but never deployed to beta users inside Artsy. So I automated it. Using Travis CI and fastlane. This post covers how I got that set up.</p>

        <p>About 3 years ago, dB. announced that Artsy <a href="/blog/2014/09/12/designing-the-public-artsy-api/">had a public API</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>The Artsy API currently provides access to images of historic artwork and related information on <a href="https://artsy.net">artsy.net</a> for educational and other non-commercial purposes. You can try it for playing, testing, and learning, but not yet for production. The scope of the API will expand in the future as it gains some traction.</p></blockquote>

<p>We've wrapped up some legal work around the developer API terms and services, <a href="https://github.com/artsy/doppler/pull/119">the PR is here</a> and I'm happy to announce that the API is ready for non-commercial production use.</p>

<p>The <strong>TDLR</strong> <a href="https://developers.artsy.net/terms">Terms and Conditions</a> today for using the Artsy API is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Non-commercial use only.</li>
<li>You only get access to public-domain artworks.</li>
</ul>


<p>The API:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is a <a href="https://robots.thoughtbot.com/writing-a-hypermedia-api-client-in-ruby">Hypermedia</a> API.</li>
<li>Covers <a href="https://developers.artsy.net/docs/artists">Artists</a>, <a href="https://developers.artsy.net/docs/artworks">Artworks</a>, <a href="https://developers.artsy.net/docs/genes">Genes</a>, <a href="https://developers.artsy.net/docs/shows">Shows</a>, <a href="https://developers.artsy.net/docs/partners">Partners</a> and <a href="https://developers.artsy.net/docs/">more</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>If you have a great idea for an app that can use public-domain data, then the Artsy API is the right place to look: <a href="https://developers.artsy.net/">https://developers.artsy.net</a>.</p>

        <p>I've worked on a few large-scale OSS projects, and I believe that people find it easier to just leave a comment and rely on a contributor to explain a problem rather than consulting the documentation. I consider doing everything you can to make people find their own answers a strong part of <a href="/blog/2016/07/03/handling-big-projects/">defensive open source</a>.</p>

<p>For the posts I write, I have an even lower tolerance for comments. For example, I added the ability to turn off comments per-post and haven't allowed comments on any posts I've written here. A lot of transitory discussion around an article happens on twitter via <a href="https://twitter.com/ArtsyOpenSource/">@ArtsyOpenSource</a>.</p>

<p>I'm willing to give it another shot though, and so I got around to creating a simple system for allowing opt-in comments on posts using GitHub Issues. The rest of this post will be about how you can do it also, and a bit about why I think GitHub Issues are a happy medium for the comments.</p>

        <p>React Native is a new native library that vastly changes the way in which you can create applications. The majority of the information and tutorials on the subject come from the angle of <em>"you are a web developer, and want to do native"</em>.</p>

<p>This makes sense, given that the size of the JavaScript/web audience is much bigger than native developers, and far more open in the idea of writing apps using JavaScript. For web developers it opens a new creative space to work, however for native developers it provides a way to work with different tools on the same problem. Considering that most developers with a few years on the platform will be comfortable with the Xcode toolset, recommending a change this drastic is a tough sell.</p>

<p>We've been using React Native now for about a year and a half, and have started to slow down on sweeping changes inside the codebase. This is great because it means we're spending less time trying to get things to work, and more time building on top of a solid foundations. Now that we're settled, it's time to start deeply understanding what happens with React Native.</p>

<p>I'd like cover a lot of the common questions we get asked about from the perspective of native developers:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is React Native?</li>
<li>How do you use React Native?</li>
<li>When is React Native a good technology choice?</li>
</ul>


<p>This article covers an awful lot, so free up at least 45 minutes, make a tea and then come back to this on your computer. It's worth your time if you're interested in all the hype around React Native.</p>

<p>A work environment dev team is a complex place. You naturally grow, and to grow safely you add process. Process is a mixed bag, it's a net benefit at the trade-off of individual's time vs team cohesion. You want to grow your team guided by smart applications of process.</p>

<p>On the other hand, working on a large open source project, it's easy to feel overwhelmed at the amount of work that needs to get done on a daily basis. The growth of your OSS team probably doesn't tie to the amount of work that needs to be done. Especially if you're like me, and you don't want to be maintaining OSS as a 2nd full-time job.</p>

<p>So what do you do? Well in a work environment you don't really have a choice, as a team you hold each other to the rules that you set. In OSS, you sacrifice your spare time or you can find time at work, you could stop or you could burn out.</p>

<p>And this is the environment in which the idea of Danger was incubated.</p>

<p>Today mark version 1.0 of the second version of Danger. I'm going to cover what they are, how they continue to grow and what I see their trajectory as.</p>

        <p>After examining the data stored in one of our high-throughput systems, we realized it might include sensitive user data. To reduce the number of people that are technically able to access the data and reduce the risks associated with a potential data theft, we decided to encrypt certain database fields.</p>

<h1>Our Goal</h1>

<p>Encrypt sensitive fields without any downtime.</p>
